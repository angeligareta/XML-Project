# XML Project

## Description
Example of a Recipe Book Page using the web technologies XML 2.0, XSD and XSL. Very useful for learning how to start using them.

The original XML file is in the XML folder and is called recipe-book.xml. The result HTML page is in the HTML folder and is called index.html. To process
the XML again there is a script called process.sh in the root, simple!
